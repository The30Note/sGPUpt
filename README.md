All rust code writen myself, based on lexi-src's sGPUpt bash script.

Still in super super basic form. Once I finish with the base translation I plan on adding: Basic Kernel spoofing, more storage options such as mdadm arrays and sata controller passthrough, command line flag implementation for almost everything, lots more spoofing to qemu and edk2 that pull from hardware info, and hopefully alot more stuff.

I'm only really familiar with Ubuntu so for now that's all that will be supported, but I'd like to improve compatibility in the future. If you'd like to contact me for any reason hmu on discord @ t30n
